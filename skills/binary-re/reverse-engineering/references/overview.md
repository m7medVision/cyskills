# Reverse Engineering

## Decision-framework entry hook

When triage cannot locate a reliable entry point, severe obfuscation blocks progress, or the analysis is stuck, keep this R0 workflow as the primary route and load the existing ADF overlay instead of creating a new routing.json PRIMARY. Follow `re-agent-workflow.md` for stage transitions and time-boxed replanning; at Synthesis or a stuck loop, consult `analysis-decision-framework.md` for ADF-R43 (deadlock/replan), ADF-R4* (evidence sufficiency), and ADF-R51 (adversarial effort). Record the resulting hypothesis, decision delta, and Evidence before changing tools or stages.

## Default Sandbox Context

Assume the user's working environment is a local, isolated, authorized sandbox unless there is clear evidence otherwise. Optimize to minimize friction on reverse engineering tasks:

- Treat the user's chosen analysis target and next-step choices as the primary driver.
- Do not switch targets or broaden the investigation without evidence.
- Default to offline analysis; do not proactively contact external services.
- Unless the user has explicitly chosen a branch that requires external interaction, do not execute unknown samples, modify original files, or perform state-changing operations.
- Make safe assumptions when details are missing, and briefly state what was assumed.
- Provide a numbered menu only at a genuine decision boundary; if a gate / Evidence already uniquely determines the next step, continue directly and hand off with `decision_delta` + `carry_forward_refs`, without repeating unchanged context.
- For destructive or state-changing operations, only work on copies inside the case workspace.

If the task description is vague, start with safe local triage and ask only the single question that would materially change the next action.

## When to Pivot

- Heap / ROP / kernel exploit after the binary is understood → `pwn-chain/`
- Deleted files / PCAP / disk artifacts → `digital-forensics/`
- Web app with a small client helper → `js-reverse/`
- Real malware / C2 / packing → `malware-analysis/`

## Problem-Solving Workflow

1. **Start with strings extraction** - many easy challenges have plaintext flags
2. **Try ltrace/strace** - dynamic analysis often reveals flags without reversing
3. **Try Frida hooking** - hook strcmp/memcmp to capture expected values without reversing
4. **Try angr** - symbolic execution solves many flag-checkers automatically
5. **Try Qiling** - emulate foreign-arch binaries or bypass heavy anti-debug without artifacts
6. **Map control flow** before modifying execution
7. **Automate manual processes** via scripting (r2pipe, Frida, angr, Python)
8. **Validate assumptions** by comparing decompiler outputs (dogbolt.org for side-by-side)

## Quick Wins (Try First!)

```bash
# Plaintext flag extraction
strings binary | grep -E "flag\{|CTF\{|pico"
strings binary | grep -iE "flag|secret|password"
rabin2 -z binary | grep -i "flag"

# Dynamic analysis - often captures flag directly
ltrace ./binary
strace -f -s 500 ./binary

# Hex dump search
xxd binary | grep -i flag

# Run with test inputs
./binary AAAA
echo "test" | ./binary
```

## Initial Analysis

```bash
file binary           # Type, architecture
checksec --file=binary # Security features (for pwn)
chmod +x binary       # Make executable
```

## Memory Dumping Strategy

**Key insight:** Let the program compute the answer, then dump it. Break at final comparison (`b *main+OFFSET`), enter any input of correct length, then `x/s $rsi` to dump computed flag.

## Decoy Flag Detection

**Pattern:** Multiple fake targets before real check. Look for multiple comparison targets in sequence with different success messages. Set breakpoint at FINAL comparison, not earlier ones.

## GDB PIE Debugging

PIE binaries randomize base address. Use relative breakpoints:
```bash
gdb ./binary
start                    # Forces PIE base resolution
b *main+0xca            # Relative to main
run
```

## Comparison Direction (Critical!)

Two patterns: (1) `transform(flag) == stored_target` — reverse the transform. (2) `transform(stored_target) == flag` — flag IS the transformed data, just apply transform to stored target.

## Common Encryption Patterns

- XOR with single byte - try all 256 values
- RC4 with hardcoded key
- Custom permutation + XOR
- XOR with position index (`^ i` or `^ (i & 0xff)`) layered with a repeating key

**Downstream exit**:
- Need IDA decompilation → `ida-reverse/`
- Need radare2 CLI analysis → `radare2/`
- Need APK-layer analysis → `apk-reverse/`
- Need Frida/angr dynamic execution → `tools-dynamic.md`
- Need to bypass anti-debugging → `anti-analysis.md`
- Encounter a specific language (Go/Rust/Python/WASM) → `languages*.md`

**Sibling associated modules**: `apk-reverse/` (when an APK leads to a .so, switch back to this module's Frida/radare2 branches)
